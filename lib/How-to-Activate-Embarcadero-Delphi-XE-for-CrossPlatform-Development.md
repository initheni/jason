However, before you can start coding and deploying your applications, you need to activate your Delphi XE license. This article will guide you through the steps of activating and configuring Delphi XE for cross-platform development.
  
## Step 1: Register Your Serial Number
 
When you purchase Delphi XE, you will receive an email from Embarcadero with your serial number. You need this serial number to register your product and activate your license.
 
To register your serial number, follow these steps:
 
- Open Delphi XE and select **Help > Product Registration**.
- In the Registration dialog box, enter your serial number, EDN login name or email, and EDN password. If you do not have an EDN account, you can create one by clicking **Create New Account**.
- Select **Register** to register your product and activate your license.

## Step 2: Add a Target Platform
 
Delphi XE supports multiple target platforms for cross-platform development. However, not all platforms are displayed by default in the Project Manager. To add a target platform to your project, follow these steps:

- In the Project Manager, right-click the **Target Platforms** node and select **Add Platform**.
- In the Select Platform dialog box, select a target platform from the list of supported platforms. You can choose from Windows 64-bit, Mac OS X 64-bit, Linux 64-bit (Enterprise edition only), iOS Device 64-bit, iOS Simulator 64-bit, Android 32-bit, or Android 64-bit.
- If you want to make the selected platform active for your project, leave the **Make the selected platform active** checkbox enabled. Otherwise, uncheck it.
- Select **OK** to add the target platform to your project.

## Step 3: Configure a Target Platform
 
After adding a target platform to your project, you need to configure some settings for that platform. Depending on the platform you choose, you may need to install and run the Platform Assistant server on a remote machine (such as a Mac or Linux computer), create a connection profile that describes how to connect to that machine, and specify some deployment options for your application.
 
To configure a target platform for your project, follow these steps:

- In the Project Manager, right-click the target platform node and select **Properties**.
- In the Project Options dialog box, select the appropriate options for your target platform. For more information on each option, see [Activating and Configuring the Target Platform](https://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/Sydney/en/Activating_and_Configuring_the_Target_Platform).
- Select **OK** to save your changes.

## Step 4: Build and Run Your Application
 
Now that you have activated and configured Delphi XE for cross-platform development, you are ready to build and run your application on your target platform. To do so, follow these steps:

- In the Project Manager, right-click the target platform node and select **Activate**. This will make the target platform the current one for your project.
- Select **Run > Run Without Debugging** or press <kbd>F9</kbd>. This will compile your application and deploy it to your target platform.
- If you are running your application on a remote machine (such as a Mac or Linux computer), you may need to enter some credentials or accept some security prompts on that machine.
- Your application should run on your target platform. You can interact with it as you would with any other application 0f148eb4a0
